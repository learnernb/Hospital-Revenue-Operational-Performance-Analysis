🏥 Hospital Revenue & Operational Performance Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital revenue, appointment trends, and operational performance using SQL and Python. The goal is to identify inefficiencies, revenue leakage, and performance improvement opportunities through structured data analysis.

The dataset simulates realistic hospital operations including patients, doctors, departments, appointments, and revenue transactions.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze hospital revenue trends over time

Identify high-performing and underperforming departments

Measure appointment cancellation rates

Evaluate doctor utilization

Provide business-driven insights to improve operational efficiency

🛠 Tools & Technologies

MySQL – Data storage & analytical queries

Python (Pandas) – Data processing

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

SQL Views & Aggregations – KPI computation

📊 Dataset Summary

5,000+ Patients

20,000+ Appointments

Multiple Departments

Revenue & Cancellation Tracking

Realistic timestamps and operational metrics

🧠 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Modeling

Structured relational schema with proper primary & foreign keys

Ensured referential integrity

Designed appointment and revenue relationships

2️⃣ SQL-Based KPI Extraction

Key SQL queries were used to compute:

Daily & monthly revenue trends

Revenue per department

Doctor-wise revenue breakdown

Appointment cancellation rate

Average revenue per appointment

3️⃣ Python-Based Analysis

Cleaned and processed SQL output

Performed trend analysis

Created visualizations to highlight performance gaps

Derived business insights from aggregated data

📈 Key Insights

Cancellation rate contributes significantly to revenue loss

Certain departments generate disproportionately higher revenue

Peak revenue days indicate scheduling concentration

Some doctors show lower utilization rates

(Replace with your real findings.)

💡 Business Recommendations

Implement automated appointment reminders to reduce cancellations

Reallocate resources toward high-demand departments

Introduce performance-based incentives for underutilized doctors

Optimize appointment distribution to balance load

🚀 Future Enhancements

Build predictive model for appointment cancellation

Add dashboard using Power BI / Streamlit

Integrate forecasting for revenue trends
